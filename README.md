- 👋 Hi, I’m @GiampieroBardella
- 👀 I'm a theoretical physicist interested in complex networks, brain networks, statistical physics and information theory. 
- 🧠 I’m currently working on the neural basis of cognitive control of movement and decision making. My research involves the analysis of complex networks built from 
      neurophysiological data using tools and approaches from graph theory, information theory and statistical physics.
- 🖥️ I’m looking to collaborate on topics regarding Theoretical Physics and Computational Neuroscience.
- 📫 You can reach me at giampiero.bardella@uniroma1.it.
